								<p>
									Hello, my name is Tim Aune and I am a candidate for ISD 197
									School Board. I grew up in Grand Rapids Minnesota and am a
									proud public-school graduate of Grand Rapids Senior High. I
									went on to The Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
									receiving a B.S in Electrical Engineering. The bulk of my career
									was with a financial analytics firm in New York.<br/><br/>

									I have lived in Mendota Heights for 18 years and have two sons
									attending schools in the district at Branch Out and Two Rivers. I
									have done extensive board work for my college alma mater,
									serving as Chair for the MIT Annual Fund Board. I continue to
									volunteer as a member of the Corporation Development
									Committee and as an Education Counselor. I am a member of
									the National Ski Patrol and patrol at Buck Hill in Burnsville. And
									I have recently tried my hand at basketball float construction
									for use during Homecoming and Warrior Rally festivities.

								<ul>
									<li>
										Ensure a safe learning environment for students and staff.

									</li>
									<li>
										Support for our curriculum and the process by which it is
										revised/evolves, as set forth by Minnesota Department of
										Education Guidelines.

								<article id="goals">
								<h2 class="major">Goals</h2>
								
								<ul>
									<li>Expand and encourage volunteer opportunities in the district, especially reading programs in our elementary schools.</li>
									<li>Review technology platforms used within the teacher-student-parent environment.  Explore options for more uniformity and address the barriers that exist for some members of the community.</li>
									<li>Managing the Social/Emotional and Educational impacts of the pandemic on our students.  This includes not only addressing present needs, but also anticipating the needs various student segments may have in the future.</li>
								</ul>
								<br/>

								<p>
									ISD 197 is a strong school district.  But we all agree there are gaps to close, and bars to raise.   I believe those gaps can be closed and those bars can be raised.  It involves rethinking the why so you can reimagine the how.  And it doesn’t involve pointing fingers it requires joining hands.
