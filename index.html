								<p>
									Hello, my name is Tim Aune and I am a candidate for ISD 197
									School Board. I grew up in Grand Rapids Minnesota and am a
									proud public-school graduate of Grand Rapids Senior High. I
									went on to The Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
									receiving a B.S in Electrical Engineering. The bulk of my career
									was with a financial analytics firm in New York.<br/><br/>

									I have lived in Mendota Heights for 18 years and have two sons
									attending schools in the district at Branch Out and Two Rivers. I
									have done extensive board work for my college alma mater,
									serving as Chair for the MIT Annual Fund Board. I continue to
									volunteer as a member of the Corporation Development
									Committee and as an Education Counselor. I am a member of
									the National Ski Patrol and patrol at Buck Hill in Burnsville. And
									I have recently tried my hand at basketball float construction
									for use during Homecoming and Warrior Rally festivities.

								</ul>
								<p>
									With the rise of political polarity and divisiveness reaching all the way to school boards, Tim will engage constructively with his fellow board members and residents of the community 
									even when there may be others that strongly disagree with him. Tim understands who the primary stakeholders are - the students. Coupled with that is the clear understanding of the role and
									authority of the school board. <br/><br/>
									With these important factors in mind, Tim will ensure the correct decisions are being made for the right people. Tim knows that it is wrong
									to divert precious time debating issues that we have nominal control over, which ultimately comes at the expense of the students. For issues within our purview, he will work to make sure we have received complete input from the community and try his best to understand how a fellow Board member, or member of the community, has come to his or her point of view.

									<br/><br/>
									<bold>CRT "Critical Race Theory" - Issue or Non-Issue</bold> <br/>
									Tim feels that the research over the past 40 years makes it clear that systemic racism did not end with the Civil Rights movement in the 60s. With the guidance of a well laid out curriculum it is something that should be taught. Tim believes that the strategic framework and four-way equity test appear to be good guidelines for shaping a curriclulum. To monitor the effectiveness of this, Tim will encourage constant engagement with members of underserved communities to ensure that over time we can work through these issues better. <br/><br/>

									Tim supports an evolving, vetted curriculum that reflects new perspectives, insights, and discoveries. This involves discussion of racism in our society. He does not view it as a mechanism for placing blame, but rather a means to have a better understanding of historical causes and how racism can be overcome.

								<p>
									ISD 197 is a strong school district.  But we all agree there are gaps to close, and bars to raise.   I believe those gaps can be closed and those bars can be raised.  It involves rethinking the why so you can reimagine the how.  And it doesnâ€™t involve pointing fingers it requires joining hands.

								<p>Being Chair of the MIT Annual Fund Board. A Board has the responsibility to set policy, but Staff needs to execute for the benefit of the stakeholders, in this case the students and parents. During my tenure I found positive results come by working in concert with staff, applauding their successes and encouraging new ideas and challenging old ones. This can be done while still holding the Administration to high standards, respectfully listening to the concerns of parents, and being wise stewards of the resources provided by the community.</p>
